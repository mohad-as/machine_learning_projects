All relevant leak occurrence detection experiments can be found in this file.Ê1- The file (Lead_occurence_detection.ipynb) contains all the code for handling data, preprocessing it, training a machine learning model, and displaying the results for the three experiments mentioned in the report.Ê2- Dataframes contain CSV files about the three experiments. Each CSV file consists mainly of three columns: relative path (for audio records), flow rate (acquired at the time of recording), and a label (depending on the experiment itself).Ê3- Each experiment's audio file can be found in the experiments file.ÊNotes:ÊTo run the code file without problems, you need to change the paths listed in the code part. You should care for three paths. These paths are the path of a data frame, a path that should complement the path of a record, and the path of the record itself (which is listed in the relative path column in a CSV file). The dataframe path can easily be edited, and the last two should be set so that they complement each other. In order to make it easier, we recommend setting the recorded audio in a way that matches the data paths in the csv file, for example, /experiments/exp1/Audio_records/.Ê- If you are working in an OS that runs on Windows, you may need to change the slash (/) to a backslash (\).Ê
